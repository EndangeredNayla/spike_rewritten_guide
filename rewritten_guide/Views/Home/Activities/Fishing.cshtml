            Fishing is a fun way to earn yourself an additional 7 laff points! At any time, in any playground
            with a pond, which is all of them, a toon can fish to earn jellybeans and/or to add new species to their fish album.
        </p>

        <h2 id="fish">How to Fish</h2>
        <p>
            To start fishing, simply walk up to any avaliable fishing dock. From here, you will see the fishing
            dashboard that displays your jellybean jar, a bucket with a capacity of 20, and a circle labled "Cast".
            To throw a line, click and hold the Cast button then pull left or right for direction and pull back for
            distance. Release the Cast button to throw the line. Each cast will cost you 1 or more jellybeans. Your goal
            is to throw a line near the moving shadows in the pond. If you successfully catch a fish, the information
            card for the fish you caught will pop up on your screen and the fish will be added to your bucket.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Gardening">gardening</a>, for every 10 new species caught and sold,
            a laff point is earned! There are 70 total species and 7 earnable fishing trophies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have reached capacity in your fishing bucket, you have to sell your fish to a fisherman or
            at the petshop. Fishermen can be found in close proximity to the pond you are fishing at. If you are
            fishing at your estate, there is a yellow bucket next to the pond where you can sell your fish. If
            you sell your fish for more jellybeans than you can carry, do not fear! The overflow will go to your
            main jellybean bank in your estate.

        <h2 id="ponds">Ponds & Rods</h2>
        <p>
            A pond is the area were a toon is able to fish. They are located in each playground and can also
            be found on any street. Note, you will not find a pond in cog headquarters, Goofy Speedway, or Chip n'
            Dales MiniGolf. Most ponds are unique in a way that they contain different types of fish species. Some
            provide a better probablity of catching certain species as well. This can be helpful when on the hunt for
            rare fishes!
        </p>
        <img class="content-img" style="height:160px;" src="~/images/mml_pond.PNG">
        <p>
            Of course to fish, a toon needs a fishing rod! There is no initial purchase necessary to start fishing,
            every toon starts out with a Twig rod. The Twig rod is the weakest tier rod and will not be able to catch
            heavier fish. But do not worry, you can upgrade your rod by purchasing them as they become
            avaliable in Clarabelle's Catalog! These upgrades are important if you are interested in catching
            all 70 fish. With each upgrade, an additional jellybean is added to the cost of casting. Check out the table
            below to see how each rod differs and what each upgrade will provide you:

        <h2 id="bingo">Fish Bingo</h2>
        <p>
            Fish Bingo is an event which happens every Wednesday and every Silly Saturday. The objective of
            Fish Bingo is very very similar to how regular Bingo works. The aim is to fill the white spots
            on the board, which will appear in your fish dashboard on the appropriate days. To do this, you have to
            catch the fish that appear on the board. If you do successfully catch a needed fish, the spot on the
            board will flash red. Be quick, that spot must be clicked before someone else marks it! If all the white
            spots are marked, the Bingo button will begin to flash and the first toon to click it gets the
            reward.

            Ready to start fishing? Great! There are many different types of fish species to catch. 
            Different types of species are found in different ponds across Toontown. Some fish are harder to find
            than others. Use the lists below as a guide to find fishes. You can organize by fish type, by rod type, 
            or by pond location. Click the links below to quickly jump to a desired section. Happy fishing!
