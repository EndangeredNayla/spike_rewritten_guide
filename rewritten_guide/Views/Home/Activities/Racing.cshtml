            Racing?! In Toontown!? G'arsh! Racing is a super fun activity and an exhilarating way to earn 3
            additional laff points for your toon. It is also a fantastic way to spend time with toon friends!
            Are you ready to cross the finish line? Any toon at any level can head on over to the speedway
            and race all day and all night!

        <p>
            You might be asking, where do I go to race? Goofy Speedway! Goofy Speedway can be found
            through a tunnel, resembling a tire, located in Toontown Central (circled below). This is right past Toon HQ, next
            to the Clothing Shop. Once visited, a toon will automatically recieve teleport access to the playground.

        <p>
            At Goofy Speedway, a toon can purchase their very own kart, earn tickets by racing on the tracks, set & beat time records,
            and earn trophies by racing other toons. Even though Goofy Speedway is another playground, it is very unlike all of the other 
            main playgrounds across Toontown. There are not any fishing ponds or gag shops, but there is a unique kart shop. 
            Likewise, the speedway uses its own form of currency for payouts and rewards: tickets!
        </p>
        <h3>Tickets</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike the rest of Toontown, jellybeans is not a valid form of payment at Goofy Speedway. Here, tickets
            are used to purchase accessories, karts, join battle races, and join grand prix races. Tickets cannot be used in other places in Toontown,
            only at Goofy Speedway. However, do not try to eat tickets, they are not as tasty as jellybeans.
        </p>
        <p>
            A toon should never loose any tickets, except when purchasing a racing item. Any race completed will provide some sort of profit
            as a reward.
        </p>
        <h3>Goofy's Kart Shop</h3>
        <p>
            In order to race on the tracks, a toon must purchase a kart, which can be done at the Kart Shop!
            Every toon starts out with 200 tickets, which allows them to buy the cheapest kart avaliable: the almighty Cruiser.
            Kart accessories and paint jobs are also available. These items can make a kart look super fast and cool! 
            To access purchased accessories, open the Shticker Book and navigate to the driving wheel symbol
            <span><img class="book-tab" src="~/images/racing_tab.PNG"></span>. Select the "Customize" tab and customize away!
        </p>

        <p>
            To join a race, walk up to one of the 12 race tunnels in the Speedway. There are four orange spots in front of each tunnel;
            Approach a spot and a confirmation box will appear. Information, including ticket deposit and qualify time, for a race 
            is shown on the boards displayed on each race tunnel.

            Toons can race on a variety of tracks to earn tickets, which in turn are used to enter more races or upgrade karts.
            Toons can also set records for the current district they are in. In the middle of the speedway playground is a score board that displays
            the high scores for each track. If a new record is set upon completing a race, a toon will
            earn an additional 1000 tickets! Toon records are stored in the Shticker Book under "Records" on the Karts page 
            <span><img class="book-tab" src="~/images/racing_tab.PNG"></span>.

        <p>
            The default controls for racing include the arrow keys (&#8592;&#8593;&#8594;&#8595;) to move and the CTRL key
            to use an attack. These controls can be modified in the Options menu.
        </p>
        <h3>Practice Race</h3>
        <p>
            Practice races require no ticket deposit to enter and can be raced solo. There are no attack items to collect on the track.
            Trophies cannot be earned and records cannot be set. Practice races are a great way to become familar with a track layout 
            and get a feel for controlling a kart on it. Toons can race on a practice track by themselves or with a maximum of three 
            other toons. Each toon in the practice race will receive 20 tickets for qualifying at the end. 
        </p>
        <h3>Toon Battle</h3>
        <p>
            For battle races, toons must race in a party of 2 to 4 toons.
            While racing, on the track there will be item boxes. Upon collecting one, a toon will be given a random attack to use,
            similar to how Mario Kart works! There are four different types of attacks, each with a different purpose:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Attack</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Banana Peel</td>
                <td>Drops a banana peel behind the driving kart, waiting for a passerbyer to hit it</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Whole Cream Pie</td>
                <td>Throws a giant whole cream pie towards a leading toon. Splatters cream on the hit toons screen</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Turbo Boost</td>
                <td>Gives a boost of speed, allowing for larger lead or catch up</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Anvil</td>
                <td>Drops a giant anvil on the 1st place kart, causing them to come to a full stop</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            Unlike practice races, battle races have payouts and deposits. Finishing in a higher place will earn a toon 
            more tickets as a reward. Most trophies are earned through toon battle races and records can be set during these races.
        </p>
        <h3>Grand Prix</h3>
        <p>
            Grand Prix races have the same rules as Toon Battle races. But in these types of events, toons will
            races through three tracks in a row (speedway, rural, and urban). These types of race events is where a toon will earn
            sweeping trophies, meaning one toon wins all three races in the series. Grand Prix races are available on Mondays.

            trophies of course. There are 30 available racing trophies and for every 10 earned, a laff point is earned.
            Sounds easy right? Well, I'll let you make that judgement...
