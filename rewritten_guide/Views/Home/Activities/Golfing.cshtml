            Golfing is a fun, sometimes tedious, game to play by yourself or with toon friends, and it is
            yet another way to earn an additional 3 laff points for your toon! Any toon at any level can
            go to Chip N' Dales Golfing and put those putt-putt skills to play.

        <p>
            Golfing in Toontown is very similar to an online mini-golf game. Toons can play mini-golf over a
            series of holes to earn laff boosts and golfing trophies. Golfing can be played individually or with
            additional toons, up to a capacity of four. Each toon takes a turn until everyone gets the ball into
            the hole or reached a limit of three shots over par.

            There are three courses available:
            <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                <th>Course</th>
                <th>Number of Holes</th>
                <th>Difficulty</th>
                <th>Kart Color</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                <td>Walk in the Par</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Easy</td>
                <td>Green</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>Holesome Fun</td>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td>Yellow</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>The Hole Kit and Caboodle</td>
                <td>9</td>
                <td>Hard</td>
                <td>Red</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each course randomly selects holes that will be played in succession. At the end of a course, the player
            with the lowest number of points will be the winner, just like real mini-golf!
            Each golfing course can be accessed via the golfs karts located all around the golfing playground, as shown
            in the image below.
