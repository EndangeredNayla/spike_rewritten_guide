        <h2>Sellbot HQ</h2>
        <p>
            Sellbot Headquarters, or commonly known as Sellbot HQ, is the base of all 
            Sellbot operations. It is located at the end of Oak Street in Daisy Gardens.
            Within the headquarters, there are the Sellbot Towers and the Sellbot Factory.
            The purpose of those two areas will be explained in futher detail below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Toons will usually visit Sellbot HQ first, as there are toontasks in Daisy Gardens
            that require toons to complete objectives in or around the headquarters.
        </p>
        <h3>Senior Vice President</h3>
        <p>
            The Vice President, also known as the V.P., is the boss of the Sellbots.
            He can be found within the Sellbot Towers at Sellbot HQ.
        </p>
        <img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;height:225px;width:auto" src="~/images/cogs/sellbots/Vice_President.png" />
        <p>
            To fight the V.P., you must complete your Sellbot cog suit disguise and be ready for a
            promotion. To enter the V.P. battle, a toon must enter the elvator within the Sellbot Towers
            with a maximum of 7 other toons. Once everyone has gone up the elevator, the V.P. 
            will be there, congratulating Cogs on their promotions. There will be a Toon hanging 
            in a cage and will give you away, rats! The V.P. get rid of each cog disguise on each 
            toon and begin attacking. Waves of Cogs and Skelecogs will challenge toons before the 
            boss battle against the V.P. himself. Once completed, the roon in the cage will be save 
            and an SOS card will be rewarded, as well as a level-up promotion of a toons cog disguise.
