        <h2>What is the main difference between throw and squirt? What are the benefits of each?</h2>
        <p>
            As both throw and squirt are both single hit gag tracks, with the exception of a level 7 gag,
            it seems like there is no obvious difference between the two tracks. You may wonder why you even
            need squirt if you have throw. The main difference between throw and squirt is accuracy. If you take
            a look at the gag details by hovering over any squirt gag in Gag Table, you will notice it
            says "Accuracy: High". If you follow the same procedure for any throw gag, you will notice it says
            "Accuracy: Medium". Because of this, if you are trying to guarantee a hit, save yourself, or stun 
            for a fellow toon, squirt would be your best choice as it has a much better chance of actually hitting
            the cog you are up against. On the other hand, if you are trying to acheive more damage, quickly defeat
            a cog, or have your turn taken sooner (as gag turns are taken in top to bottom order), 
            then throw would be your better option as it has higher precidence and evokes higher damage.

        <h2>Why is being a soundless toon such a bad thing?</h2>
        <p>
            Personally, I do not think there is any problem with being a soundless toon. Almost everyone in Toontown
            has sound, so one toon not having it does not seem like much of an issue for me. However, a lot of other
            toons feel differently than I do! A lot of toons feel that being soundless makes gameplay longer and it puts
            a hiccup in the typical gameplay strategy for multiple types of cog related activities. Sound is a quick way
            to defeat a round of cogs if used correctly and if one toon does not have sound, there are less opportunities
            to quickly run through a battle. With all of that being said, if you want to be a soundless toon, I strongly 
            encourage it! There are more gameplay strategies out there than just sound and it is a blast to explore more
            ways to play Toontown! And do not worry, there are plenty of toons out there who would be more than happy to
            include a soundless toon on their team!

        <h2>What is the benefit of maxing out the gardening shovels if you have all 40 flower species before that?</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, the only benefit of maxing out the shovels is gaining access to the various Toon Statues you can plant 
            outside your toon estate. Other than that, you just have bragging rights.

        <h2>How long have you been playing Toontown, Spike?</h2>
        <p>
            I do not mean to brag but..... I am just kidding! I have been a huge fan and active toon ever since the 
            opening of Disney's Toontown Online in 2003. I was barely 6 years old then but the love for the game carried through
            my childhood. Of course the closing of the original game was extremely disappointing but I am grateful for the revival.
            I received a beta key for Toontown Rewritten in 2014 and have been playing ever since.
